# Used-Car-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the prices of used cars based on various features such as age, mileage, fuel type, and more. Leveraging data-driven insights, this project employs machine learning models to make accurate price predictions.

# Overview
Buying or selling a used car can be challenging without proper valuation. This project aims to simplify the process by building a machine learning model that predicts car prices based on historical data.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from CarDekho and includes information about various car features and their corresponding selling prices.

# Key Columns:
Car_Name: Name of the car
Year: Year of manufacture
Present_Price: Current ex-showroom price
Selling_Price: Price at which the car was sold
Fuel_Type: Type of fuel used (Petrol/Diesel/Other)
Seller_Type: Individual or Dealer
Transmission: Manual or Automatic
Owner: Number of previous owners

# Workflow
Data Loading: Importing the dataset for analysis.
Data Exploration: Initial checks and summary statistics.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features to enhance the dataset.
Feature Scaling: Standardizing features to ensure comparability.
Encoding Categorical Features: Converting categorical data into numeric format.
Model Building: Training machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.
Model Evaluation: Measuring performance using metrics like R-squared, RMSE, etc.

# Models Used
Random Forest

# Results
The project achieved significant accuracy in predicting car prices, demonstrating the effectiveness of the applied machine learning models. For detailed evaluation metrics, refer to the notebook.
